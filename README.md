# React Tic Tac Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of this execise is to create a functional `Tic Tac Toe` game which:

- Given 2 players (X and O ... names are up to you just a suggestion)
- When a player clicks a square should be marked with that player's symbol
- If someone wins the games:
  - All squares should be disabled
  - A message should be displayed with the text: `The winner is: <strong>[SYMBOL]</strong>`
- If no ones wins the game:
  - All squares should be disabled
  - A message should be displayed with the text: `Game over, <button>new game?</button>` which will restart the game

Advice:

- We don't know everything and we don't expect you to know it, use Google, Stack Overflow, others when you needed it
- This is a pair programming execise, the person with you is there to help üòâ
- We üíò TDD
- Having a fully functional game at the end of the test is nice but not a requirement, good structured code and a clear idea is better than working üçù code.
- Have fun doing it!
